# ofxCLeye openFrameworks addon


This addon is a light wrapper around the CL Eye SDK. Most of the code is duplicated from the addon by Elliot Woods (source here: <http://kimchiandchips.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/oF/addons/ofxCLeye/>).

This addon has been adapted to openFrameworks v. 0.7.4. Apart from that, it is mostly the same as Elliot's code.

## Notes
- It seems the library (independent of oF) is not quite stable regarding camera detection. Furthermore, detecting CL Eye devices after a 'soft' reboot seems problematic. Since this looks like a 3rd party problem, we can't really do much about that.
